# -🛒 Retail-Sales-Predictor

This project applies multiple regression algorithms to forecast retail store sales based on historical data. It involves comprehensive data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation to build accurate sales prediction models.

By analyzing both product and outlet-level characteristics, the project aims to uncover key features that drive sales performance. The ultimate goal is to empower retailers with data-driven insights to optimize inventory management, promotional strategies, and overall decision-making.

# 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains both product-level and outlet-level features that influence retail sales. Below is a description of each variable:

Variable	Description

•Item_Identifier	: Unique product ID

•Item_Weight	: Weight of the product

•Item_Fat_Content : Indicates whether the product is low fat or regular

•Item_Visibility	: Percentage of total display area of all products allocated to this product in the store

•Item_Type	: Category to which the product belongs (e.g., Dairy, Snacks, Household)

•Item_MRP	: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product

•Outlet_Identifier	: Unique store ID

•Outlet_Establishment_Year	: The year the store was established

•Outlet_Size	: Physical size of the store (e.g., Small, Medium, High)

•Outlet_Location_Type	: Type of city in which the store is located (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2)

•Outlet_Type	:Type of outlet (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket Type1/2/3)

•Item_Outlet_Sales	: Target variable — Sales of the product in the particular store
